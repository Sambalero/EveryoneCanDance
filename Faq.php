                    Honestly, that's probably not true. Part of the inspiration for this class was my friend Susan's experience after having a hip replacement. She forgot that she didn't need legs to dance and thought she would have to give up dancing. She was deeply moved when I reminded her that she could dance if she wanted to. We did several wonderful dances together sitting in chairs.

                    There's a dance instructor - a great one at that - here in Portland who's legally blind. He did learn to dance before losing his vision, so maybe his case doesn't count as proof, but he's a very good dancer. And there's a blind fellow who graduated from my first class who probably didn't learn to dance before losing his vision, and he's doing just fine, thank you very much.

                    There are a lot of little ways in which it might be more difficult for one person to dance than another. Arguably, there a lot of things that might enable one person to dance better than another. But I don't know that there is a way that someone who wants to dance actually can't.

                    I have yet to do a finger dance, or a left foot dance, but it's not too late. Maybe one day I'll have a recording of one to post here.

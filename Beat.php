                    Average people, hearing most music, agree on what "the beat" is. They can tap their foot to it, and they will tap in unison. Most people also think "the beat" is hard to hear in some music. Interestingly, different people find different music difficult. Of course, not everyone is average. Some people can conform, some easily, some with effort, some not at all. Most dance forms do not require conformance, but some do. Sadly, some beginning dance teachers require conformance when it's not necessary, but others are not so rigid.

                    If you want to be in a parade with a marching band, you need to be able to move to the beat. If you want to win at most dance competitions, you need to be on beat.  But if you want to dance, that is nowhere near as important as it would seem.

                    It's also not as simple as it might seem. Here's some points to consider:

                <p>
                    1. For some kinds of music, there's more than one major beat. This is especially true of salsa and some other kinds of jazz. Often, people disagree which beat is the correct one. Often complex computer programs that analyze music can't agree either. Sometimes experts choose to agree that there isn't a correct beat.                </p>
                <p>
                    2. For some kinds of dance, the correct beat is whichever beat you choose. A lot of people still say that about blues dancing, for example.

                <p>
                    3. For some kinds of dance, the beat is not very important. Other aspects of the music and movement can be more important: form, focus, melody, the story: any number of things can be so important that we ignore the beat while dancing, at least part of the time. This is true of country swing and a great many other dances. Arguably, there are even kinds of dance in which the beat does not matter at all.

                    4. Dance is the expression of the feeling you get when you listen to music by moving to the music.For some people the feeling is all about the beat they hear. For others, the beat may not even be involved. Sometimes dance is about finding someone else's beat. Sometimes dance is about finding your own. Sometimes it's about something entirely different.

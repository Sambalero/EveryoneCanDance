                    In part, I was inspired by <a href="History.php" >Ev Marcel's Anyone Can Dance Class.</a> In addition to Ev's observations, I  heard complaints that I felt should be addressed, and saw personal challenges that people worked with. Among other things, people's definitions of dance and assumptions around dance were in conflict.

                    Dance is something that children do, that almost all mammals do, that birds do, for goodness sake, and yet that a lot of adults think they can't do. A long time ago, I sometimes felt that way myself - or felt that others might feel that way about me. I think all people should know that they can dance if they want to.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dance has made my life better in uncountable and indescribable ways. Knowing that I can dance if I want to has brought me much joy and goodness and I want to share that with everyone!

                    The goals of my dance class are two-fold. First, I want to get people to get out and dance. I love dancing.Dance is good for you, dance is fun, and I think dance is a gift. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    The second goal of the class is to prepare people for beginner dance classes so that they can succeed in them. 
                </p>
                <p>                    
                    Everyone can dance, and everyone should have the opportunity to know that. I think this little class, or a variation of it, should be available to everyone everywhere.

                    Dance is the simplest thing in the world, but there's lots to think and say about it. This page is going to wind up being many pages...

                    Dance has a myriad of definitions. After a lot of thought and soul searching I defined dance for myself as "the expression of a feeling I get while listening to music through movement to the music." When I do that with another person, I call it partner dancing. By my definition, everyone who feels anything while listening to music, and who can move at all, can dance.

                    In partner dancing, the leader is always in charge, always responsible, and always right, which makes it all really fun and easy. Of course, that also means the leader is  always to blame, but by following a very few important principles, that need not be very challenging.
                <p>
                    Following is even more fun. The really hard part about following is, well, following. This is especially challenging, since without the responsibility for knowing everything about everything and leading someone else, it's comparatively easy to know what should be led. Instead, the follow gets to concentrate on the beat the leader designates, even if it's not the one she hears.

                    It really matters that both partners agree about the <a href="Beat.php" >beat. </a> Establishing that agreement with the follower is the first thing the leader has to do.  If it's not working, the leader might want to stop trying to lead and "just go with the flow."

                    Merengue is easy. Step in place to the music and you're doing the footwork. You don't have to stay in one place, but you don't want to lose your partner, either.

                    The connection is just contact. Never grab or grasp, unless it's to save someone from falling. The follower is the one who maintains the connection and contact. The leader makes that possible. We like the leader's hand open, palm up and the follower's hand open, palm down, on top of that. The leader guides the follower wherever he likes, and if she agrees, she follows.

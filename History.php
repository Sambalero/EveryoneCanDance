                    This class is loosely based on the "Anyone Can Dance" class (aka "Partner Dancing for Absolute Beginners"), conceived and created around 2001 by my friend Ev Marcel, whom I greatly admire, after she took some beginning dance classes in Eugene, Oregon. She said:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I thought the beginning classes were very difficult.  I noticed that many students showed up for the beginning classes and became lost almost immediately.  Many of them did not return after 1, 2, or 3 classes.  It did not matter what teacher was teaching.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It was too advanced for someone who had never danced before.  Trying to learn upper body movements (turns) while trying to keep a rhythm with their lower body (feet) was way beyond their capabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I thought there needed to be a class for an adult that was very basic, yet got people dancing quickly.  I also thought the class needed to be fun, plain and simple.  People learn quickly when they are having fun."
                </p>
                <p>
                    I briefly assisted Ev with one of her classes a couple of years later. I was thoroughly impressed. Ev used "swango" as the basis for her class and expanded on that over the years. This was clearly something the dance community and the community at large needed. I felt Ev's class was a greater service to the community than any other dance class I had seen. It was exactly what I would like to do if Ev weren't already doing it. I resolved to do so if I ever moved away from Eugene.

                <p>
                    Ev also taught Argentine tango. As of this writing Ev is not currently teaching dance, but if she starts again, and you get a chance to take her classes, I strongly recommend you do so. 
                </p>

                    In 2012 I started this class at the Mount Scott Community Center in Portland.

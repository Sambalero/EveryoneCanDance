                    The best, most important, most fundamental, most powerful, most...mostest lead in dance is the body lead, also called a mass lead, also called leading from one's center, and also described other ways. My intent is to represent that here.

                    The pink rectangle on the left is following the blue rectangle, but in an unconnected fashion. Pinky follows the big mass. It's natural. There's a delay because the lead is visual. And if there's no resistance, it makes no difference if they're connected.

                    On the right there's some resistance in the connection. The follower is still following, but they are starting to move together. Once they get in sync, they move as one.

                    But having introduced that concept, we'll completely abandon it, and use Merengue, with nothing but hand-and-arm leads to get us in the mood. These are not at all like body leads. They are frivolous and playful, but they take practice to get used to and this will be a great way to do that. Don't worry. We'll come back to body leads with blues dancing.

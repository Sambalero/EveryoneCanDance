                    This class has  two primary goals:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Prepare the student to comfortably and confidently take beginner dance lessons of any sort</li>
                        <li>Teach  enough fundamental dance skills to dance in most simple social dance situations</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The class covers 3 dances that incorporate the most fundamental dance basics. Arguably, all formal dances are simply ways to combine and dress up these basics.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Blues: Moving</li>
                        <li>Merengue: Stepping</li>
                        <li>One Step: Traveling</li>
                    </ol> 
                 </p>
                <p>               
                    The main concept is lead-and-follow
                    <ul>
                        <li>Leader's responsibilities: pretty much everything. </li>
                        <li>Follower's responsibilities: allow the leader to lead</li>
                    </ul>
